# **Phase 4: Routing, State Management, and Responsive Design**

**Concepts to Cover**

* **Responsive Design**

  * Why Responsive Design matters
  * Media Queries Basics
  * CSS Units (`rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`) vs Pixels
  * Flexbox and Grid fundamentals
  * Mobile-First Design Approach
* **React Router**

  * Setting up React Router (`react-router-dom`)

* **Redux Toolkit**

  * What is Redux? Why use it?
  * Setting up Redux Toolkit in a React project
  * Creating Slices, Actions, and Reducers
  * Connecting Redux state to components using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`

**Practice Tasks**

âœ… Make your previous React app fully mobile-responsive. \
âœ… Implement a simple responsive navbar with navigation using **React Router**.\
âœ… Use **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to create a responsive card layout.\
âœ… Create a simple **Redux store** for global state (e.g., theme toggle or counter).\
âœ… Replace Context API with Redux in a previously built app (optional).

# **Phase 5: Capstone Project with Tailwind CSS**

**Concepts to Cover**

* Installing and using Tailwind CSS in React
* Tailwind utility classes (margin, padding, color, layout, etc.)
* Responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
* Theme switching using Tailwind and Redux
* Hosting and deploying (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)

**Mini Project: Personal Portfolio Site**

* Create a complete personal portfolio with proper component structure
* Integrate **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
* Use **React Router** for page navigation (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
* Use **Redux Toolkit** for theme toggling or form submission state
* Optionally document components in **Storybook**


**Practice Tasks**\
âœ… Build a responsive landing page with multiple sections (About, Projects, Contact).\
âœ… Implement routing for all pages using **React Router**.\
âœ… Use **Redux** to manage global state (e.g., dark/light theme).\
âœ… Style the UI using **Tailwind CSS** (instead of SASS).\
âœ… Showcase work using reusable and responsive Card components.\
âœ… Host the site on **GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**.\
âœ… (Optional) Document a few components (e.g., Button, Card) in Storybook.
