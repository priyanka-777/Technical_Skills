Directory for practing Javascript Basics

# Topics and Phases to be covered:


### **Phase 1: JavaScript Basics**
#### **Concepts to Cover**
- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`) 
- Data Types (String, Number, Boolean, Object, Array, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt) 
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise, Assignment) 
- Control Flow (`if`-`else`, `switch`) 
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `forEach`) 
- Functions (`function`, arrow functions, default parameters, rest/spread) 

#### **Practice Tasks**
- Create a script that prints "Hello, World!"
- Write a function to check if a number is even or odd. 
- Create a function that reverses a string. 
- Implement a loop that prints numbers 1-100 with "FizzBuzz" logic.

### **Phase 2: Intermediate JavaScript**
#### **Concepts to Cover**
- Objects (`this`, methods, prototypes)  
- Arrays (map, filter, reduce, find, some, every)  
- Destructuring (Array, Object)  
- Spread and Rest operators (`...`)   
- Template Literals   
- Callbacks and Promises (async programming)   
- Error Handling (`try-catch`, `throw`)   

#### **Practice Tasks**
- Create an object representing a book and access its properties dynamically.   
- Implement an array method to filter out even numbers from an array. 
- Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.    
- Use `Promise` to fetch fake API data and handle the response.    

---

### **Phase 3: Functional Programming**
#### **Concepts to Cover**
- Immutability (`Object.freeze`, `const`, spread)   
- Pure Functions   
- Higher-Order Functions   
- Closures 
- Recursion   
- Function Composition   

#### **Practice Tasks**
- Write a pure function that returns a new array with doubled numbers.    
- Implement a function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to an array.     
- Use closures to create a counter function. 
- Implement a recursive function for calculating factorial.   

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Topics**
#### **Concepts to Cover**
- ES6+ Features (`async/await`, optional chaining, nullish coalescing)   
- Modules (`import`, `export`) 
- Event Loop & Asynchronous JS 
- Prototypes & Inheritance   
- Web APIs (`fetch`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`)   

#### **Practice Tasks**
- Create a simple `fetch` API call and display the data.   
- Implement a debounce function. 
- Build a small counter app using the DOM and event listeners.
- Save and retrieve user preferences in `localStorage`.

---

### **Practice Project**
Build a **Task Manager App** that allows users to:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Persist data in `localStorage`.
